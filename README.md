# FitnessApp

**FitnessApp** is a web application developed with a technology stack that includes React for the front-end, Node.js/Express for the server-side, and a MySQL database. As a gym rat myself, I created this app to provide a convenient way to track workout progress and stay motivated while also delving into the world of React, a highly relevant technology in the tech industry.

You can access the app at [WeGoJim.net](https://WeGoJim.net). Feel free to register and explore its features. After logging in, you can set up your profile to estimate your daily calorie intake and expenditure. The central hub of the app is the dashboard, where you can:

- Update your weight as frequently as you like.
- Create and manage personalized workout routines.
- Track your progress for individual exercises of your choice.

Whether you're a fitness enthusiast or someone looking to start their fitness journey, this app is designed to help you achieve your goals and enjoy the process.

Thank you for using my app, and I hope you find it useful and motivating!
